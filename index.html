                        <p>As Pharrell Williams said, “chords are like coordinates”, they take you to a place. Music captures an essence or a feeling. The power of music and audio is that it draws us back to the present. It connects us to a moment. And in doing so creates a stake in the ground that we can return to; a feeling that we can recapture. That is why music is so important to me. </p>
                        <p>I would love to be part of the team at Spotify that leverages technology, business acumen and design through highly customer focused approaches to optimise user experiences with music. My experience lends me well to the role. During my placement year at Intel, I Identified the need for and designed a pricing tool using PowerBI that gave pricing managers real time, product specific, visual insights to help inform their pricing decisions. The tool was rolled out to other business units/regions and is now used globally by Intel pricing managers. Throughout the development process, I partnered with pricing managers, data scientists, engineers and other relevant stakeholders to make the tool more user friendly and intuitive. I learnt the value of empathy, stepping into the shoes of my colleagues to understand roadblocks in usage and putting in measures to mitigate them. Integrating the tool into people’s workflow required understanding their current habits. It was key to work closely with my manager to ensure the tool aligned with Intel’s business objectives and could facilitate more beneficial and efficient business decisions. I developed my skills in storytelling and tailoring messaging to suit an audience, presenting my idea to various stakeholders including senior management. </p>
                        <p>There has never been a more exciting time to craft digital user experiences. With the growth of generative AI, I could see a future where Spotify can compose playlists or recommendations to the exact written specifications of the consumer. Could we get to a point where consumers can specify a feeling or mind state rather than a genre or artist? In a world full of distractions, consumers are becoming more aware of the harm ‘tech’ can have on their productivity and wellbeing. Spotify could be the guiding force towards a new era of mindful consumer ‘tech’ engagement; one that encourages consumers to connect more deeply with the world around them; one that uses audio to complement our surroundings and get us into the desired state of being; to help us focus, relax, have fun, release emotion. It would be amazing to craft the future of user experiences with Spotify that take consumers to where they want to go, whether they know it yet or not. </p>
                        <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
